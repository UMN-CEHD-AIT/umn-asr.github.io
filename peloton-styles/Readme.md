# Peloton Styles
These are the core styles for CEHD websites. Here you'll find CSS for colors,
fonts, layout and a set of patterns for our pattern library.

## Using the styles

[Download the latest version](https://github.umn.edu/cehd-web-common/cehd-styles/tree/master/cehd-styles/dist/css/releases).

The easiest way to start is to just use include all.css in your project. If you
want, some styles have been split out to be included inline or only on pages
where you need them. In that case use styles.css and include the other
stylesheets as you need them.

### Generating styles on your own

1. [Install npm if you haven't already](http://yoember.com/nodejs/the-best-way-to-install-node-js/).
2. [Install Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Make changes to the Sass files.
5. Run `gulp` to regenerate CSS or alternately, run `gulp watch` for styles to regenerate every time you save changes.
