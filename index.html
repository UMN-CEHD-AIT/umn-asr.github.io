    <p>We use two interviews. In the first you'll meet with a small group of ASR employees to discuss the job, your previous experience, and your qualifications. The first interview can be done remotely. In the second interview you'll pair program with Custom Solutions developers using your programming language of choice. Each interview takes 60-90 minutes and will be scheduled on different days. Oh, and we won't ask you to code anything on a whiteboard.</p>
