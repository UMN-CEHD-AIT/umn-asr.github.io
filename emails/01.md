Thank you for registering for Gopher Day of Coderetreat!

I'm excited that you're joining us. I think it will be a fun, edifying, and exhilarating day.

More details will be sent to you soon. But first I wanted to answer some questions that I've received.

"Can people from outside the U of MN sign up?"

Yes! This event is open to everyone. Feel free to share the details with anyone you like. I tried to contact all of the local programming meetups, but I'm sure that I missed a bunch.

"How do I let you know if I decide I can no longer attend?"

You have two options. You can go back to the RSVP page and change your answer, or you can email me directly at whit0694@umn.edu

"Can I use [insert programming language here]"

Probably! Throughout the day we'll be working on implementing Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and you should be able to to do that in any programming language.

I do ask that if you bring your own laptop you have it set up to run whatever programming language you want to use. Our day will be very full and we won't have time to configure 

"What should I bring?"

Not much. If you have a laptop, bring it. Maybe some pens, pencils & paper?

"What's the agenda?"

8:30 - 9:00 Social time, breakfast
9 - 9:45 Programming session 1

In a 'programming session' you will be pairing with another attendee and working on Conway's Game of Life. You'll have a different pair for each programming session.

"What's the food situation?"

I'm still finalizing this, but I expect to have some continental breakfast options (and coffee) available in the morning. Lunch will probably be pizza, sandwiches or burritos. Snacks and pop will be available throughout the day. We will be providing vegan and nut-free options. If you have other dietary needs please let me know at whit0694@umn.edu

Happy hour will not be paid for, by the way. You're on your own dime for that part of the day.
