## We do cool stuff

### VideoAnt video annotation tool

[VideoAnt](https://ant.umn.edu/) is a web-based video annotation tool for
mobile and desktop devices.  Use VideoAnt to add annotations, or comments, to
web-hosted videos.  VideoAnt-annotated videos are called "Ants".

### Center for Open Education

The Open Textbook Library is just one part of [this center committed to making
educational resources open and accessible](http://open.umn.edu/).


### Other projects

We also support around 20 web applications to support the College of Education
and Human Development administration. We also support a custom Wordpress theme
used for creating child themes, a pattern library and over 100 websites for
college departments and centers.
