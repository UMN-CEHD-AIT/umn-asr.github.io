## Problem solvers, advocates and leaders

### About Us

The AIT software development team is a small, dynamic group of developers that value:
- well-tested software and test-driven development
- pair programming and team ownership of code
- close, empathetic collaboration with customers
- professional development and continuous learning

We work in an open, collaborative environment. The development team works
closely together to help solve problems and build web applications. Solid
communication skills go hand in hand with autonomy to build cool stuff for the
college.
