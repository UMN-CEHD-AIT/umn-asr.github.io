## How to apply

The job is listed on the University's <a
href="https://z.umn.edu/asr_dev3_external">University's job application

- A resume
  - Formatted or plain text, either is fine
- A cover letter
  - Explain why you're interested in the job and why you're a good candidate
- Names and contact information for three references
  - Mentors, bosses, co-workers, people you study with or talk to at meetups

*We place a lot of value on the cover letter*. Tell us what excites you about
this job, work you've done and where you want your career to go. This is more
interesting to us than a list of technologies you've used.

You can take a break at any point during the application process. Click the
<strong>Save Draft</strong> button and your application will be saved for
later. When you log back into the job application system, click <strong>My

## What's the difference between Developer 2 and Developer 3?

Experience mainly. A Developer 3 is expected to have more experience in the
field and we look for a broad range of experience. A Developer 2 position is
for someone who maybe hasn't been at as long.

For us specifically, the Developer 3 person will have to support some projects
in Ruby on Rails, for example. That person will have to work on the full stack
from server configuration, to the back end application to the front end UI.

Ready to apply? Great! Start at <a
