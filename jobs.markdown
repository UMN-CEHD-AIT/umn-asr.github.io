# Jobs
## We want to work with you

### Developer 3

<a href="http://cehd.umn.edu/">CEHD</a> AIT is hiring a new developer and we
want it to be you! We're looking for a developer ready to lead.

Developer 3s are our "Tech Leads". They design and architect our applications.
They pair program to deliver high quality code. They improve the team's
practices. And they improve themselves by mentoring, speaking and helping the
U's IT community.

The Web Applications team delivers applications that improve the student
experience and support CEHD administration. We've listed some of our tools over
on our [projects page](projects.html). Most of our work is in .NET, though we
also work in JavaScript, PHP and Ruby.

## Values

Our sites are built with code, but their foundation is our team values

- Diversity: A mix of experiences, opinions and approaches makes all our work better
- Best Practices: Use and refine techniques like Pair Programming and Test Driven Development that result in better code
- Continuous Learning: We dedicate time each week for learning new tools, languages and techniques
- Mentoring: Take what you have learned and return it to the community

## Benefits

The Office of Human Resources has a <a
href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits">guide to all of the University's
benefits</a>, including the <a
href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/tuition-benefits">Regent's
Scholarship</a>, <a
href="http://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/retirement#anchor-auto">Faculty
Retirement Plan</a>, <a
href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/vacations-and-leaves">Leave</a>
and <a
href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/medical">Medical</a>

## Interviews

We use three interviews. The first is a short phone interview with the team
lead and one of our developers.

The second interview is in person with a small group.

In the third interview you'll pair program with a developer to solve a
real-world problem that you might encounter on the job. This interview is less
about finding and solving the problem in a short period of time as it is about
pairing with another developer and getting some exposure to a project you'd
support.

Each interview will be scheduled on different days.

Oh, and we won't ask you to code anything on a whiteboard.

## How to apply

The job is listed on the University's <a
href="https://z.umn.edu/asr_dev3_external">University's job application
system</a>. Before you start, you should have:

- A resume
  - Formatted or plain text, either is fine
- A cover letter
  - Explain why you're interested in the job and why you're a good candidate
- Names and contact information for three references
  - Mentors, bosses, co-workers, people you study with or talk to at meetups

*We place a lot of value on the cover letter*. Tell us what excites you about
this job, work you've done and where you want your career to go. This is more
interesting to us than a list of technologies you've used.
